RL Trading for final year dissertation

Code based from Nigel Cuschieri, Vince Vella, and Josef Bajada. Td3-based ensemble reinforce-
ment learning for financial portfolio optimisation. FinPlan 2021, page 6, 2021., with thanks
Some critisism to make: The original code included only 25 stocks from SP 500 , not all, giving a high limitation for the model to perform well
                        This project removed such restrictions and input as many stocks from SP500 as possible with the limitation of giving enough                                 training time for the model to perform.
